**If replacing Mind Fray with Arc Lightning:**

- Each chain does 85% of previous damage
- 8 second cooldown

**Visual:**

**Narrative Flavor:**
"The Archmages saw connections everywhere. Now, so do I."

### Narrative Integration
**One Story Moment (Floor 3):**
When Theron reaches the Heart Chamber interior (Floor 3), he has a revelation:

**Theron (touching a corrupted altar):** "I can feel it... the Binding. Everything is connected. The Tower, the kingdom, the corruption... even us."

**Guardian Spirit:** "You perceive truly. Use this understanding."

**Garrick:** "Theron, your eyes just lit up. What happened?"

**Theron:** "I... I understand how they think now. How they saw the world. It's beautiful. And terrifying."

[Arc Lightning slightly buffed after this moment: +1 chain target, becomes 6 total hits]
