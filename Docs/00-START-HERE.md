### üìù Not Started
- Character stat system (STR/VIT/AGI/RES/FOR)
- Gear/equipment system
- Materials or idle systems
- Save/load system
- Hub system

**For detailed status:** See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) in project root (updated daily)

## üéØ Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Be honest about progress** - No aspirational completion percentages
2. **Prove before building** - Each phase validates a hypothesis
3. **Simplify ruthlessly** - Cut features that don't serve the core loop
4. **Playtest constantly** - Record yourself playing, watch it back
5. **Ship small** - 2-week MVP beats 6-month vaporware

### Sequential Risk Reduction
We build in phases where **each phase proves a hypothesis** before investing in the next:

- **Phase 1:** Prove combat is fun ‚úÖ **PROVEN**
- **Phase 2:** Prove progression hook works
- **Phase 3:** Prove idle systems add value
- **Phase 4:** Add depth (mastery, mods)
- **Phase 5:** Endgame content (multiple dungeons)

**Current Focus:** Finishing Phase 1 UI ‚Üí Move to Phase 2

- **CLAUDE.md** updates frequently, **Docs/** updates when stable

### For Deep Dives
1. Start with overview docs in `01-GAME-DESIGN/`
2. Check implementation details in `02-IMPLEMENTATION/`
3. Review specific content in `03-CONTENT-DESIGN/`
4. Reference visual style in `04-VISUAL-AUDIO/`

### For Claude AI Assistance
When asking Claude for help:
- "Read `02-IMPLEMENTATION/phase-plan.md` for context"
- "Follow patterns from `02-IMPLEMENTATION/godot-patterns.md`"
- "Check `CLAUDE.md` for current implementation status"
