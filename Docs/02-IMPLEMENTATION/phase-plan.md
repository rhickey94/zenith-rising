# Sequential Development Plan

## Development Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Build in phases where **each phase proves a hypothesis** before investing in the next.

**Why Sequential:**
- Validates assumptions early
- Prevents wasted work on features nobody wants
- Allows pivoting based on feedback
- Ships faster (MVP in weeks, not months)

## Phase 1: Prove Combat is Fun ✅ PROVEN

**Hypothesis:** "Fighting waves with skills and upgrades is engaging for 25+ minutes"

**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESS** - Combat validated as fun through playtesting

### Completed ✅
- Player movement and shooting mechanics
- 3 enemy types (Basic, FastMelee, SlowRanged)
- Enemy AI with virtual methods (Attack/Movement/TryAttack)
- Health/damage system with crit
- Power XP/Power Level flow (per-run progression)
- 8 working Power Upgrades (stacking fixed)
- 3 functional skills (Whirlwind, Fireball, basic attacks)
- Wave/floor system (10 waves + boss per floor, 5 floors total)
- Enemy scaling (HP/damage mult per wave/floor)
- Boss spawning at 5:00 mark
- Main menu with styled buttons
- Floor transition UI (Continue/End Run buttons)
- Victory screen (Floor 5 completion)
- Death screen with stats
- Results screen with stat allocation
- Boss defeat detection via TreeExited signals
- HUD integration with Dungeon.cs

### Success Criteria ✅ Met
- Combat feels engaging
- Power Upgrades matter
- Enemy variety works
- Want to play "one more run"
- Complete game loop: Menu → Combat → Death/Victory → Menu

### Cut from Phase 1 ✂️
- Character stat system (Phase 2)
- Gear drops (Phase 4)
- Materials/idle (Phase 5)
- Save system (Phase 2)
- Hub world (Phase 3)

---

## Phase 2: Progression & Persistence ✅ COMPLETE

**Hypothesis:** "Players want to push further because permanent progression feels good"

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Character stat system and save/load working

### Completed ✅

1. **Character Stats System**
   - 5 stats: STR/INT/AGI/VIT/FOR
   - Each stat provides specific bonuses (damage, health, speed, regen, crit)
   - +1 point per Character Level (permanent progression)
   - Stat allocation panel (press C in-game)
   - Stats properly scale with formulas

2. **Character XP & Leveling**
   - Character XP tracked separately from Power XP
   - Character XP awarded at end of run based on performance
   - XP formula: 50 base + 100 per floor + 150 per boss + 500 victory bonus
   - Character Level persists between runs
   - Results screen shows Character XP earned

3. **Save/Load System**
   - JSON-based save file (SaveManager.cs + SaveData.cs)
   - Saves Character Level, stats, XP, highest floor
   - Saves Power Level and active upgrades (run state)
   - Persists between sessions
   - Continue Game button on main menu
   - Checkpoint system: saves on floor completion

### Deferred to Phase 4 📝
- Gear drops (requires inventory UI)
- Distinct floor visuals (cosmetic)

### Success Criteria ✅ Met
- Permanent progression working
- Save/load reliable
- Stat allocation feels impactful
- Players motivated to earn character XP

---

## Phase 3: Hub World & Scene Flow ✅ COMPLETE

**Hypothesis:** "Hub as safe zone enables meta-progression systems and improves game feel"

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Hub functional and integrated

### Completed ✅

1. **Hub Scene**
   - hub.tscn with player spawn at (0, 0)
   - Hub.cs manages player initialization
   - CallDeferred used to ensure proper component initialization
   - Background placeholder (dark blue/purple)

2. **Dungeon Portal Interaction**
   - DungeonPortal.cs with Area2D detection
   - "[E] Enter Dungeon" prompt when in range
   - 'interact' input action (E key)
   - Smooth transition to dungeon.tscn

3. **Scene Architecture**
   - Renamed game.tscn → dungeon.tscn for clarity
   - Renamed Game.cs → Dungeon.cs
   - All transitions return to hub (not main menu)
   - Death/Victory/End Run all return to hub
   - Main Menu → Hub → Dungeon → Hub flow

4. **Player Initialization Fix**
   - Fixed Player.Initialize() to handle new game case
   - Previously only loaded saves, now initializes fresh stats
   - Bug prevented movement on new games (CurrentSpeed = 0)
   - StatsManager.Initialize() now called for fresh starts

### Success Criteria ✅ Met
- Scene transitions smooth
- Player movement works in both hub and dungeon
- Save/load works from hub
- Foundation for future systems (vendors, crafting, idle)

### Deferred to Future Phases 📝
- Placeholder NPCs (Phase 4+)
- Hub ambient sounds/music (Phase 7 polish)
- Portal visual effects (Phase 7 polish)

## Phase 3.5: Warrior Combat Implementation ⏳ IN PROGRESS

**Focus:** Complete ONE class (Warrior) fully to validate animation and skill standardization systems

**Status:** ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** - Animation phases 1-4 complete, skill standardization planned

**Why this phase:** Before building 18 skills across 3 classes, validate systems with 5 warrior skills end-to-end.

### Architecture Completed ✅

**Animation System (Custom FSM + AnimationPlayer)**
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Sprite2D + AnimationPlayer setup)
- ✅ Phase 2: Locomotion (walk/idle animations, 4 directions)
- ✅ Phase 3: State Machine (PlayerState enum, transition logic)
- ✅ Phase 4: Combat Animations (warrior_attack, warrior_whirlwind with Call Method tracks)
- ⏳ Phase 5: Hitboxes (Area2D nodes + collision handlers) - IN PROGRESS

**Skill Standardization Framework**
- ✅ Two-axis classification (CastBehavior × DamageSource)
- ✅ Six implementation patterns identified
- ✅ All 18 skills mapped to patterns
- ✅ Hybrid hitbox approach designed (PlayerHitbox for melee/AOE, EffectCollision for projectiles)
- ✅ Documentation created ([skill-standardization.md](skill-standardization.md), [animation-architecture.md](animation-architecture.md))

### Implementation Phases (A-E)

**Phase A: Skill System Standardization** (2-3 hours) 📝 NEXT

---

## Phase 7: Endgame 📝 PLANNED

**Hypothesis:** "Multiple dungeons with varying lengths sustain long-term interest and respect player time"

### Tasks

1. **Multiple Dungeons (6 total)** - Varying lengths for different session times
   - **Research Station Kepler** (4 floors, 20-25 min) - Quick challenge dungeon
   - **Military Blacksite Omega** (7 floors, 35-40 min) - Extended commitment dungeon
   - **Megacity New Babel** (8 floors, 40-45 min) - Epic run dungeon
   - **Frost Grave** (6 floors, 30-35 min) - Mind-bender dungeon
   - **Verdant Tomb** (9 floors, 45-50 min) - Ultimate challenge dungeon
   - Note: Zenith Station (5 floors, 25-30 min) is the MVP dungeon built in Phases 1-3

2. **Ascension System**
   - Unlocks at Character Level 50+
   - Reset to Character Level 1, keep gear and skill mastery
   - Gain +5% permanent damage per ascension
   - Unlock new Power Upgrade tiers and cosmetics

3. **Difficulty Tiers**
   - Normal dungeons (current)
   - True difficulty (higher enemy scaling, 2x loot)
   - Nightmare difficulty (extreme scaling, 5x loot)

4. **Weekly Challenges** (stretch goal)
   - Special modifiers on dungeons
   - Leaderboards
   - Exclusive rewards

### Design Philosophy
**Respect player time through content variety:**
- Players with 20 minutes? Run Research Station (4 floors)
- Players with 30 minutes? Run Zenith or Frost Grave (5-6 floors)
- Players with 45+ minutes? Run Verdant Tomb (9 floors)
- All session lengths provide meaningful progression

### Success Criteria
- 20% 3-month retention
- Players engage with multiple dungeons (not just farming one)
- Average 5+ different dungeon completions per week
- Positive feedback on "respecting time" in reviews

### Implementation Priority
**Ship dungeons sequentially, not all at once:**
1. Research Station + Military Blacksite (update 1)
2. Megacity + Frost Grave (update 2)
3. Verdant Tomb + Ascension system (update 3)

**Each release = content update = renewed player engagement**

**See [`../01-GAME-DESIGN/dungeon-structure.md`](../01-GAME-DESIGN/dungeon-structure.md) for complete dungeon designs**

## What We're NOT Building

**Cut Forever:**
- Research Lab (passive power gain)
- Training Ground (weird currency)
- 3+ material types
- Complex gear synergies
- PvP/multiplayer (for MVP)

**Why Cut:**
- Doesn't serve core loop
- Adds complexity without value
- Can add later if players demand

---

## Current Focus

**See [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) for current session progress and next tasks.**

*This plan is flexible - we pivot based on validation results.*
