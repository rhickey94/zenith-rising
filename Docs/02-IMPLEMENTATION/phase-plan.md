# Sequential Development Plan

> **üìå MVP SCOPE:** Phases 1-3 + 3.5 = Core gameplay loop validated
>
> **üìù POST-MVP:** Phases 4-7 = Expansion content and retention features
>
> For current implementation status, see [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md)

## Development Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Build in phases where **each phase proves a hypothesis** before investing in the next.

**Why Sequential:**
- Validates assumptions early
- Prevents wasted work on features nobody wants
- Allows pivoting based on feedback
- Ships faster (MVP in weeks, not months)

## Phase 3.5: Warrior Combat Implementation ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

**Focus:** Complete ONE class (Warrior) fully to validate animation and skill standardization systems

**Status:** ‚è≥ **IN PROGRESS** - Balance systems foundation prioritized before skill implementation

**Why this phase:** Before building 18 skills across 3 classes, establish centralized balance infrastructure and validate systems with 5 warrior skills end-to-end.

### Architecture Completed ‚úÖ

**Animation System (Custom FSM + AnimationPlayer)**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (Sprite2D + AnimationPlayer setup)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Locomotion (walk/idle animations, 4 directions)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: State Machine (PlayerState enum, transition logic)
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: Combat Animations (warrior_attack, warrior_whirlwind with Call Method tracks)
- ‚è≥ Phase 5: Hitboxes (Area2D nodes + collision handlers) - IN PROGRESS

**Skill Standardization Framework**
- ‚úÖ Two-axis classification (CastBehavior √ó DamageSource)
- ‚úÖ Six implementation patterns identified
- ‚úÖ All 18 skills mapped to patterns
- ‚úÖ Hybrid hitbox approach designed (PlayerHitbox for melee/AOE, EffectCollision for projectiles)
- ‚úÖ Documentation created ([skill-standardization.md](skill-standardization.md), [animation-architecture.md](animation-architecture.md))

---

### Implementation Phases (A-F)

**Phase A: Balance Systems Foundation** (4-6 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Why this phase came first:**
Setting up centralized balance systems BEFORE implementing remaining skills prevented:
- Hardcoded magic numbers scattered across 18 skill files
- Manual recompilation for every balance tweak
- Inconsistent formulas between similar skills
- Difficulty comparing and tuning related values

**Investment pays off:**
- 4-6 hours setup ‚Üí saves 10+ hours during skill implementation/tuning
- Makes Phases B-F dramatically faster
- Enables rapid iteration during playtesting
- Creates sustainable architecture for future content

**Tasks:**

1. **Create BalanceConfig System** (2 hours)
   - Create `Scripts/Core/BalanceConfig.cs` with nested config classes:
     - PlayerStatsConfig (base health, speed, damage)
     - CharacterProgressionConfig (stat scaling formulas)
     - CombatSystemConfig (crit damage, damage types)
     - EnemyConfig (scaling, aggro, spawn rates)
     - UpgradeSystemConfig (upgrade values per stack)
   - Create `Scripts/Core/GameBalance.cs` singleton for global access
   - Create `Resources/Balance/balance_config.tres` resource
   - Wire up GameBalance as autoload in Project Settings
   - Assign balance_config.tres to GameBalance.Config export

2. **Create SkillBalanceDatabase** (2 hours)
   - Create `Scripts/Skills/Balance/SkillBalanceType.cs` enum
   - Create `Scripts/Skills/Balance/SkillBalanceEntry.cs` data structure
   - Create `Scripts/Skills/Balance/SkillBalanceDatabase.cs` container
   - Create `Resources/Balance/skill_balance_database.tres` resource
   - Wire up to GameBalance.SkillDatabase export
   - Add entries for existing skills (Whirlwind, Fireball, WarriorBasicAttack)

3. **Refactor Existing Systems** (1-2 hours)
   - **StatsManager.cs**: Replace constants with BalanceConfig reads
     - STR_DAMAGE_PER_POINT ‚Üí Config.CharacterProgression.StrengthDamagePerPoint
     - VIT_HEALTH_PER_POINT ‚Üí Config.CharacterProgression.VitalityHealthPerPoint
     - etc. for all stat scaling
   - **UpgradeManager.cs**: Replace hardcoded upgrade values with Config reads
     - DamageBoostPerStack, AttackSpeedPerStack, etc.
   - **Dungeon.cs**: Replace enemy spawn/scaling values with Config reads
   - **Enemy.cs**: Replace aggro/leash ranges with Config reads

4. **Update Skill Loading Pattern** (1 hour)
   - Add `skill.Initialize()` method that loads from SkillBalanceDatabase
   - Update Skill.cs base class with runtime properties (not exports)
   - Only SkillId remains as export - all other values load from database
   - Update SkillManager to call skill.Initialize() before first use
   - Simplify skill .tres files (only SkillId + visual references)

**Testing & Validation:**
- Verify StatsManager reads player stats from config correctly
- Change a balance value in inspector, run game, confirm change takes effect
- Verify skills load damage/cooldown from database
- All existing skills (Whirlwind, Fireball) still work correctly

**Documentation:**
- Create `Docs/02-IMPLEMENTATION/balance-systems-architecture.md`
- Update this file with "Phase A Complete" when done

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ GameBalance singleton accessible globally
- ‚úÖ balance_config.tres holds all game-wide tuning values
- ‚úÖ skill_balance_database.tres holds all skill-specific values
- ‚úÖ StatsManager/UpgradeManager/Dungeon read from config (no constants)
- ‚úÖ Skills load from database (no exported damage/cooldown values)
- ‚úÖ Can tune balance in inspector without recompiling code

---

**Phase B: Skill System Standardization** (2-3 hours) üìù NEXT AFTER PHASE A

**Tasks:**
- Add CastBehavior and DamageSource enums to Skill.cs
- Update SkillManager.UseSkill() to route based on CastBehavior
- Add hitbox infrastructure to Player.cs (EnableMeleeHitbox, EnableAOEHitbox, etc.)
- Create BasicAttackHitbox and WhirlwindHitbox Area2D nodes in player.tscn
- Wire collision signals to Player.cs handlers
- Update Player state machine to handle CastingSkill state

**Why after Phase A:** 
Skills will load balance from database, so database must exist first.

---

- Prove Melee Pattern works end-to-end
- Configure WarriorBasicAttack.tres (load from database)
- Add Call Method tracks to warrior_attack animations
- Implement OnMeleeHitboxBodyEntered() damage application
- Test: left-click ‚Üí animation ‚Üí hitbox ‚Üí damage ‚Üí kill tracking
- Tune damage/range in skill_balance_database.tres until it feels good

**Why after Phases A+B:** 
Database must exist (Phase A), hitbox infrastructure must exist (Phase B).

---

**See [`../01-GAME-DESIGN/dungeon-structure.md`](../01-GAME-DESIGN/dungeon-structure.md) for complete dungeon designs (if exists)**

---

## What We're NOT Building

**Cut Forever:**
- Research Lab (passive power gain)
- Training Ground (weird currency)
- 6+ material types (5 is the limit)
- Gear crafting from scratch (Forge modifies drops, doesn't create)
- PvP/multiplayer (for MVP)

**Why Cut:**
- Doesn't serve core loop
- Adds complexity without value
- Can add later if players demand
- 5 materials already provides enough complexity

---

## Current Focus

**Phase 3.5 - Phases B-E (Remaining Warrior Skills)**

Phase A (Balance Systems) is complete! Now implementing the remaining 3 warrior skills using the established patterns and centralized balance database.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Phase A Complete: Balance infrastructure ready
- ‚úÖ Basic Attack (Fusion Cutter) functional
- ‚úÖ Whirlwind functional
- üìù Crowd Suppression - planned
- üìù Combat Stim - planned
- üìù Breaching Charge - planned

**See [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) for current session progress and next tasks.**
