UPGRADE BALANCING NOTES
Stack Limits Explained:
Why Some Stack:

Small bonuses (+damage, +speed) need stacks to feel impactful
Gives long-term scaling across 20 levels
Creates build variety (go deep on one stat vs broad)

Why Some Don't:

Build-defining effects would be broken if stacked
Epic upgrades are powerful enough alone
Prevents degenerate combos

Rarity Weights:
Common (60%):

Should always feel useful
Build foundations
Safe picks

Uncommon (30%):

Enables synergies
More interesting choices
"Oh that's nice" moments

Rare (8%):

Build-defining
Exciting when they appear
"Hell yes!" moments

Epic (2%):

Run-defining
Completely changes playstyle
Memorable moments

FINAL THOUGHTS
Total Upgrade Count:

Universal: ~35 upgrades
Per-Class: ~35 upgrades each
Grand Total: ~140 unique upgrades

This gives:

Deep build variety
Replayability (different upgrades each run)
Synergy discovery
Meta progression (learning which combos work)

But stays manageable:

Each run: See ~20 upgrades (out of 140)
Clear descriptions
No overwhelming choices
Focus on fun, not spreadsheets

Want me to:

Design specific boss encounters that test different builds?
Create achievement/challenge ideas around builds?
Plan the Training Ground permanent upgrade tree?
Write the tutorial sequence for teaching upgrade system?
