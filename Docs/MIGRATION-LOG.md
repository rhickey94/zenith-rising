## Verification Checklist

After deletion, verify:
- [ ] All old files deleted
- [ ] New structure exists and is complete
- [ ] Git commit made
- [ ] No broken references in documentation
- [ ] CLAUDE.md still in project root
- [ ] This MIGRATION-LOG.md can be deleted after verification

## Result

**Before:** 11 files, lots of redundancy, 4 versions of same doc
**After:** 13 focused files, clear hierarchy, no redundancy

Each file now has ONE clear purpose, and the folder structure guides navigation.
