## Narrative Considerations

### If You Choose Humans (Tatermand)

**Narrative stays as-is:**
- Human soldiers exploring alien tower
- Augmented/powered armor explains abilities
- "Breacher/Conduit/Sharpshooter" = military specializations
- Fits existing narrative framework perfectly

**Example flavor:**
> "The Tower appeared overnight. Command sent in augmented strike teams—Breachers to breach, Conduits to interface with alien tech, Sharpshooters to provide precision elimination. None returned. You're going in."

### If You Choose Robots (PenUsbMic)

**Narrative adjustments (minor):**
- Humans send in robotic proxies
- OR humans have fully integrated with machines (cyborgs)
- OR distant future where humanity IS synthetic
- Still works! Just different flavor

**Example flavor:**
> "Humanity's solution to the Tower: Synthetic operatives. No fear. No hesitation. Upload, deploy, adapt. If you fall, your consciousness transfers to a new chassis. The Tower won't kill you. But it might trap you forever."

### Mix Both (Advanced Option)

**Narrative flexibility:**
- Humans control robotic exo-suits/mechs
- Each "class" is a different mech configuration
- Damage to sprites = mech damage, not human death
- Best of both worlds narratively

## Final Thoughts

**You have TWO excellent free options:**

**Tatermand = Human soldiers** (free, legendary quality)
**Kenney = Simple soldiers** (free, fast setup)

**And ONE excellent paid option:**

**PenUsbMic = Robots** ($7.50, perfect aesthetic)

**All three work!** Your narrative accommodates either humans OR robots. The question is:

1. Do you want FREE and excellent? → **Tatermand**
2. Do you want FAST and simple? → **Kenney**
3. Do you want ROBOTS specifically? → **PenUsbMic**

**My vote:** Try Tatermand first. It's free, professional, and matches your theme perfectly. If you decide you want robots later, you can always switch to PenUsbMic. But I think you'll be thrilled with Tatermand's human soldiers.
