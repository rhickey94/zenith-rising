## For Sci-Fi Look

The LPC generator is fantasy-themed, but you can make it work:

### Option 1: Use "Tech" Assets
- Some armor looks tech/futuristic
- Plate armor + gray color = robot-ish
- Modern hair + tech vest = sci-fi soldier

### Option 2: Recolor in Photopea/GIMP
- Download character
- Open in Photopea
- Change colors to metallics (grays, cyans)
- Add tech details if you want

### Option 3: Mix with Sci-Fi Elements
- Use LPC base body + armor
- Add your own weapon effects
- Kenney particles for attacks
- Works great!

## Why This is Better Than Tatermand

**Tatermand:**
- ‚ùå Gun poses (hard to use for melee)
- ‚ùå Complex PSD layers
- ‚úÖ Perfect sci-fi aesthetic

**LPC Generator:**
- ‚úÖ Correct poses for ALL weapon types
- ‚úÖ Instant generation (no PSD editing)
- ‚≠ê Fantasy style (but recolorable to sci-fi)

**Verdict:** LPC is faster and has correct poses. Use it to start, consider Tatermand for polish later if you want ultra-sci-fi look.
